\description{
List of lists, should contain a "Type" entry with a function to determine type of vector passed in.
Next entries are keyed off returned types from function, and represent the type of a row.
The returned list should contain the same list of types, and represents the type of a column. Thus it now returns
a function to process the intersection of those two types.
